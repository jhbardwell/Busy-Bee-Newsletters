# ![About](/images/about.png)About 
Content sorting and organization can be a chaotic mess. It's much like hunting for the right pollen-laden petals among a random field of flowers. But bees always know where to go. They have received a shimmy-wiggle dance of directions. They have a cozy hexegon nook waiting for that pollen. They have built an entire honeycomb of nooks. Their honeycomb is dynamic, changing at need. And bees craft different combinations of honeycomb for each hive with precisce, meticulous care. We could learn much watching the bees work. Why not pattern digital content management using methods pioneered by such diligent experts?

Busy Bees efficiently schedule, organize, encode, and populate content in lieu of pollen. They use a series of template sections instead of nooks, which can be rearranged into different honeycomb patterns of templates. And templates can be organized into themed hives. User input sorting algorithms--that all important dance--direct the bees to patrol several sun dappled fields of databases that surround a given hive. One could also devise a beekeeper to clean the hives and tend to the flowers favored by particular bees,  ala a webscraper, to search for and maintain those databases. But perhaps I am stretching the metaphor like honey scraped across too much bread.

In its current iteration, the program uses a series of fantasy ebook newsletter-themed templates with associated sample databases, but the underlying hierarchical concept is both modular and broadly applicable. After the [Prototype Stage](#Roadmap) is finished, the freeware portion of this project will also be finished. However, the final prototype shall forever remain available on github.io so that folks can playtest the concept, and links will be posted to the next successive stage of development.

When life dumps a mountain of data in your lap, don't get mad, get busy. Send out the Busy Bees!

Are you a private invidivual, entrepeneur, or company sending newsletters to a ravenous content-craving public? Do you find yourself scraping the bottom of the barrel once too many times in a never ending slog to satiate your consumers? Did you ever wish there was a tool that could automatically sort that archived content you spent so much time generating, manage the cyclic repetition at levels you preset, and compose that newsletter using section template content you select? 

You are? Then let Busy Bees craft your newsletter for you.
