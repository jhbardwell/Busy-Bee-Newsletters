# ![About](/images/about.png)About 
Content sorting and organization can be a chaotic mess. It's much like hunting for the right pollen-laden petals among a random field of flowers. But bees always know where to go. They have received a shimmy-wiggle dance of directions. They have a cozy hexegon nook waiting for that pollen. They have built an entire honeycomb of nooks. Their honeycomb is dynamic, changing at need. And a different combination of hobneycombs conveniently slot into each hive. 

Busy Bees efficiently schedule, organize, encode, and populate content in lieu of pollen. They use a series of template sections instead of nooks, which can be rearranged into different honeycomb patterns of templates. And templates can be organized into themed hives. Programmable sorting algorithms--that all important dance--direct the bees to patrol several sun dappled fields of databases that surround a given hive. 

In its current iteration, the program uses a series of newsletter-themed templates, but the underlying hierarchical concept is both modular and broadly applicable. After [Version 2.3](#Roadmap) is finished, the freeware portion of the development stage will be complete, but the final POC will remain available on github.io, and links will be posted to find the next successive stage of development.

Are you a private invidivual, entrepeneur, or company sending newsletters with periodic repeating information to a ravenous content-craving public? Do you find yourself scraping the bottom of the barrel once too many times in a never ending slog to satiate your consumers? Did you ever wish there was a tool that could automatically sort that archived content you spent so much time generating, manage that pesky repetition at levels you preset, and compose that newsletter using section templates you select? 

You are? Then let Busy Bees craft your newsletter for you.
