# ![About](/images/about.png)About 
Content sorting and organization can be a chaotic mess. It's much like hunting for the right pollen-laden petals among a random field of flowers. But bees always know where to go. They have received a shimmy-wiggle dance of directions. They have a cozy hexegon nook waiting for that pollen. They have built an entire honeycomb of nooks. Their honeycomb is dynamic, changing at need. And a different combination of hobneycombs conveniently slot into each hive. 

Busy Bees efficiently schedule, organize, encode, and populate content in lieu of pollen. They use a series of template sections instead of nooks, which can be rearranged into different honeycomb patterns of templates. And templates can be organized into themed hives. Programmable sorting algorithms--that all important dance--direct the bees to patrol several sun dappled fields of databases that surround a given hive. One could also devise a beekeeper to clean the hives and tend to flowers favored by particular bees,  ala a webscraper, to search for and maintain our databases. Perhaps I am stretching the metaphor like honey scraped across too much bread.

In its current iteration, the program uses a series of newsletter-themed templates with associated sample databases, but the underlying hierarchical concept is both modular and broadly applicable. After [Version 2.3](#Roadmap) is finished, the freeware portion of this project will also be finished. However, the final prototype shall forever remain available on github.io so that folks can playtest the concept, and links will be posted to the next successive stage of development.

When life dumps a mountain of data in your lap, don't get mad, get busy. Send out the Busy Bees!

Are you a private invidivual, entrepeneur, or company sending newsletters with periodic repeating information to a ravenous content-craving public? Do you find yourself scraping the bottom of the barrel once too many times in a never ending slog to satiate your consumers? Did you ever wish there was a tool that could automatically sort that archived content you spent so much time generating, manage that pesky repetition at levels you preset, and compose that newsletter using section templates you select? 

You are? Then let Busy Bees craft your newsletter for you.
