## About 
This program was created as a tool for entrepeneurs who send email newsletters to efficiently schedule, organize, encode, and populate the content of those newsletters using a series of template sections which each reference their own metadatabases. The current first iteration targets ebook marketers, but the core concept is broadly applicable, and further development will add a second layer of abstraction with a drag-and-drop GUI to allow for more template flexibility and an overall greater degree of customization.
